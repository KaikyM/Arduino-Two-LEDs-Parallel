# Arduino-Two-LEDs-Parallel

## Contextualization
In this experiment, the micro servo on PWM pin 11 will be controlled. A micro servo is a motor that allows for control of its position, commonly used in aeromodelling. The most common servo is the TowerPro 9g SG90 micro servo. In the first test, the servo will move in increments of 90 degrees. In the second test, it will move from 0 to 180 degrees. In the third test, it will move in increments of 60 degrees. Finally, in the fourth test, it will move in increments of 45 degrees. In all tests, the servo will return to its initial position after achieving its goal.

## Components:
